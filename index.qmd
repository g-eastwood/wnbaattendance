  A central question in the intersection between sports economics and sports analytics is how to quantify the effects of what happens on the court or field on a team's revenue. In general, the literature expects that stronger teams will see higher live game attendance, but previous research has not found a statistically significant relationship between winning percentage and attendance in the WNBA [@AghaBerri2023]. Our study improves upon theirs by using a rolling win count from the past 44 games played rather than a seasonal winning-percentage to predict per game attendance. This avoids look-ahead bias, as fans cannot be expected to know a team's future performance when deciding to attend a game. Using game-level data for all WNBA regular-season games from 2018–2024, we estimated an ordinary least squares model of per-game attendance with team and season fixed effects and a dummy variable for whether Caitlin Clark played. We then translated player win shares into expected attendance impacts by mapping individual contributions to team wins onto the estimated attendance–winning relationship. We chose to focus on attendance as a proxy for revenue following the research framework from Scully (1974), due to concerns about revenue data availability. We used attendance data from the “Across the Timeline: WNBA League Attendance Dashboard”, which records game-level attendance data for all WNBA games. We find a significant relationship between rolling win count and game attendance, with game attendance expected to increase by 112 people for each additional win in the 44 game window. This means that a player like Allisha Gray, for example, who we estimate contributed 10 wins to the Atlanta Dream in 2024, boosted attendance by approximately 1,100 attendees per game. These results highlight the importance of short-run performance in shaping fan demand and provide a framework for linking individual player performance to team-level revenue outcomes in women’s professional sports.

## Introduction
Research on pay and performance in sports economics often centers on how teams value player contributions and how those valuations translate into compensation. A central challenge in the field is determining the appropriate metrics for quantifying an individual player’s impact on team success and linking that impact to team revenues and attendance. Different modeling choices can lead to significantly different conclusions about whether players are compensated fairly for their contributions to the game. As a relatively young league with rapid growth in viewership [@wnba2024recordseason] but limited publicly available financial data, accurately valuing player contributions in the WNBA is difficult. We have found attendance data to be the most reliably available indicator of revenue, making the link between on-court performance and fan demand especially important for understanding the valuation of players.

The underlying assumption of marginal revenue models is simple: fans are more interested in watching good teams. In their 2014 paper, Coates et al. use a consumer-choice model to explain what impacts a fan’s choice to attend a live MLB game. While they look specifically at baseball, it is reasonable to assume that similar considerations apply to other sports as well. Coates et al. explain the traditional model for explaining fan behavior: the uncertainty of outcome hypothesis. This is idea that fans are more likely to attend games when the outcome is uncertain, making the game more exciting. But more recent behavioral economics suggests that people evaluate gains and losses relative to a reference point and tend to dislike losses more than they like equivalent gains [@CoatesHumphreysZhou2014]. They argue that applying this idea of loss aversion may better explain why fans choose to go games than the uncertainty of outcome hypothesis. They use MLB live-game attendance data to find attendance patterns consistent with the hypothesis that fans are less likely to attend games in which they expect the home-team to lose [@CoatesHumphreysZhou2014].
  
Building on the idea that wins translate directly into fan interest and team revenue, Scully’s 1974 study on pay and performance in Major League Baseball is one of the first empirical studies on the labor market in a professional sports environment [@HolmesSimmonsBerri2018]. Scully investigates whether MLB players were undervalued relative to their estimated marginal revenue products [@Scully1974]. He estimates players’ marginal revenue products by regressing a team’s revenue on their winning percentage and computing individual players’ contributions to their teams winning percentage. This allows him to evaluate how much each player contributed to the team’s total revenue in a season, estimating their marginal revenue product and comparing it to their salary. Scully’s study came two years after the first players strike in baseball history, and aimed to evaluate whether players’ claims that they were being systematically undervalued were accurate. Scully finds that the average MLB player at the time was being paid 20% of his marginal revenue contribution, and that exploitation was higher for early career players [@Scully1974]. He also finds that certain exceptional players were being overvalued compared to their estimated marginal revenue contributions, and hypothesizes this reveals that players can generate revenue for their teams outside of their effect on game outcomes (i.e. the Caitlyn Clark effect).
  
Subsequent scholars have raised important critiques of Scully’s method. Krautmann criticizes Scully’s method by showing that the results are highly sensitive to how a player’s contribution to team performance is measured [@Krautmann1999]. Because there are many possible ways to quantify an individual’s on-field contribution, his critique highlights the need—especially for our research—to use a rigorous and defensible metric for estimating the number of wins each player contributes. In his 1991 paper on salaries and performance in MLB, Zimbalist notes that Scully’s model doesn’t account for how poor play can contribute to a team’s losses and thus may inflate the marginal revenue product of each player [@Zimbalist1992].
	
  Finally, situating these revenue models within broader league structure, sports economists have written extensively about the relationship between winningness and team revenue, particularly about how competitive balance benefits teams across the league in generating revenue. While teams and fans want to win as many games as possible, significant imbalance in winning percentages across a professional sports league will tend to decrease viewership as spectators will only watch a game if they have some uncertainty about the outcome [@PerlineNobleStoldt2018]. The various professional sports leagues in the United States have all instituted financial restrictions on teams in their leagues in the interest of competitive balance, such as across-league revenue sharing, salary caps, and reverse-of-finish drafts. The fundamental premise behind all of these attempts to protect competitive balance is that by normalizing the amounts that teams are spending on their rosters you can weaken the ability of richer teams to ‘buy wins’ and level the playing field enough to keep things interesting. This ought to increase the revenue of the whole league by encouraging attendance and engagement. In their study of competitive balance in NCAA basketball, Perline et al. found that the women’s game was significantly less balanced than the men’s game, looking at the standard deviation and the range of winning percentages for teams in the women’s division I conference [@PerlineNobleStoldt2018]. They hypothesize that the difference in the competitive balance of the men’s and women’s games could be one cause of lower revenue generation and attendance in the women’s game. The importance of class balance to the health of a league is interesting, but ultimately outside the scope of our research which seeks to quantify how players’ performance contributes to their team’s revenue in the WNBA.

In their 2023 paper comparing the in person attendance demand of the WNBA and the NBA, Agha and Berri attempt to establish whether different forces shape demand for attendance in the WNBA and the NBA. They model attendance in both leagues as a function of the population of the team’s home location, the winning percentage of the team, the per capita income of the area, championships won and player quality. Interestingly, they don’t generate statistically significant results for the effect of winning percentage on game attendance in the WNBA, while it is significant in the NBA [@AghaBerri2023]. They hypothesize that this may be due to decreased media coverage of the WNBA, and the fact that the WNBA is a much younger league, but they don’t explain why these factors would decrease the effect of winning percentage on game attendance. Although Agha and Berri did not find statistically significant effects, our method differs from theirs in two important ways. Firstly, we are regressing onto raw per game attendance counts rather than attendance as a percentage of arena capacity. Percentage of arena capacity does not directly capture attendance or game demand as arena sizes vary across teams, so raw attendance counts more effectively reflect fan demand. Secondly, we introduce a rolling win count over a 44 game window rather than using seasonal winning percentage to predict per game attendance. This avoids look-ahead bias, as fan behavior can not be reasonably expected to reflect future unseen team success. Replicating their analysis with a simpler model focused solely on win count and fixed team and seasonal effects may yield clearer evidence on how team performance influences attendance. We aim to build upon their work by combining their model with Scully’s and first regressing game attendance onto win count, and then using player statistics to estimate individual player contributions to winning percentage. This would allow us to evaluate how a player’s on-court performance contributes to game attendance, and therefore revenue. In Scully’s original 1974 model, attendance multiplied by ticket price serves as an estimate for team revenue. While our analysis cannot capture broadcast or merchandise income, game attendance remains a meaningful indicator of team visibility and revenue generation, and it is by far the most complete and publicly available dataset. Focusing on attendance as the response variable is therefore both practical and justifiable.

## Data {#sec-data-methods}
To quantify individual players’ contributions to a team’s, we reconstruct Win Shares using Dean Oliver’s framework, approximating offensive and defensive contributions using available box score statistics. These metrics were developed using Dean Oliver’s metrics from *Basketball on Paper*, [@oliver2004basketball] and the Basketball Reference team has extensive documentation of their formula online. The Offensive Win Share metric is simply the marginal offense of a specific player (calculated using Dean Oliver’s points produced and offensive possessions measures) divided by the marginal points per win for the player’s team. Marginal offense for each player is calculated as the difference between the points they produce and the number of points an average offense would be expected to produce in the same number of possessions: marginal offense = (points produced) − B × (league points per possession) × (offensive possessions). Marginal points per win is a metric that quantifies how many points a team is expected to need to win, considering the team’s average pace (possessions per game) in the context of the league average pace. Defensive Win Share puts a player’s Defensive Rating (points allowed per 100 defensive possessions) into the league pace context using the same marginal points per win metric. A player’s overall win share is simply the sum of offensive and defensive win shares [@BasketballReference_WS]. Because the analysis focuses on relative player contributions within teams, any scaling differences between the reconstructed Win Shares and Basketball Reference’s published values do not affect the interpretation of the results.

Our analysis relies on three primary data sources, to fit the two parts of our model connecting attendance to winning percentage and winning percentage to individual player contributions. The first source is the “Across the Timeline: WNBA League Attendance Dashboard”, which compiles game-level attendance data for all WNBA teams across multiple seasons. This dashboard allows us to examine trends in fan engagement over time and compare attendance across teams, and it contains a record of the in-person attendance for every WNBA game since 1997, when the league began [@AcrossTheTimeline_WNBA_Attendance]. The data includes teams that no longer exist, but we only plan on using records from active teams. The second source is Basketball Reference’s individual WNBA player stat sheets, a comprehensive collection of player-level performance metrics. These stat sheets provide detailed statistics for each player in categories such as points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, etc [@BasketballReference]. Importantly, with these stat sheets we can compute Win Shares as a metric for player contribution as outlined above. Basketball Reference also has a repository of team and league statistics useful for computing the team and league pace metrics necessary for the Win Shares computation.

We also rely on the wehoop R packages API call to access league wide game-logs to generate rolling win counts [@hutchinson_gilani_2021_wehoop].

@tbl-attendance shows the attendance of home games (and a special match played in Vancouver) in 2025 for the Atlanta Dream. Already, you can notice a major outlier: the season opener played on May 22nd against the Indiana Fever. We would expect season openers to be well attended, but this outsized effect is likely due to Caitlyn Clark's stardom.

![Distribution of WNBA game attendance by season](images/attendance_boxplots.png){width=0.9\textwidth}

Figure 2 shows the attendance distributions across the years studied. There is no attendance data from 2020, because all games that year were played in the WNBA bubble. These boxplots demonstrate the widely reported increase in WNBA game attendance, the attendance distributions from 2024 and 2025 are significantly higher than the years that came before and the range of attendance is larger.

## Attendance and Rolling Win Counts

Utilizing the framework of Scully's 1974 paper into pay and performance in the MLB, we regressed live game attendance onto a rolling winning count to understand how a team's strength is related to their home turnout in the WNBA. We chose not to use to-date season winning percentage because we worried that sparse data at the beginning of the season would affect our results. Instead, we computed a rolling win count, which looked back at a team's 44 prior games (the length of a WNBA season) and count how many games were won across that period. We chose to leave this as a count instead of a winning percentage to make the results easier to interpret. 

![Regression results for attendance model](images/table_model.png){width=0.9\textwidth}

We fit an Ordinary Least Squares Regression model onto the data, regressing attendance onto rolling wins over the prior 44 games, and including fixed effects for day of week, month, team, and season. We chose to include these basic controls in order to account for market level factors on game attendance outside of what happens on the court. The model has an adjusted $R^2$ of 0.63, which means the factors included explain a substantial amount of variation in game-level attendance, but far from all. Interestingly, before including an indicator variable for Caitlin Clark's presence in a game the adjusted $R^2$ was 0.56, meaning that her presence explains an additional 7% of the variance in attendance. The fixed effect of Caitlin Clark's presence in the game is 8843, meaning that her presence is expected to boost attendance by 8,843 fans. The Caitlin Clark effect on WNBA game attendance is well recorded [@bleacherreport_wnba_attendance_2025], informing our decision to include her presence as an indicator variable in the model, and the effect on $R^2$ provides further justification for this decision. 

The model's incomplete explanation of variance in game attendance makes sense because there is high variance in game attendance, and noise may be introduced by one-off events. Rolling win count has a positive and statistically significant effect on attendance, with an estimated 112 additional attendees per each additional rolling win. This supports our expectation that recent team success boosts game attendance, but reminds us that are also a lot of other factors at play. Many of the team effects in the table above are large and statistically significant, demonstrating that teams have different fanbases- affecting attendance in ways that are not attributable to team performance alone. These results confirm our decision to include team indicator variables, because including these fixed effects helps ensure that the performance coefficient is not confounded by fixed differences in team demand. Not shown in Figure 3 are the seasonal fixed effects, which are significant and reflect the attendance trends shown in Figure 2.

![Attendance and Rolling Wins; games highlighted include Caitlin Clark](images/caitlin_clark.png){width=0.9\textwidth}

Figure 4 shows the estimated coefficient from the OLS line on the rolling win count over the past 44 days, controlling for team fixed effects, season fixed effects, day-of-week and month effects, and the presence of Caitlin Clark in the game. The y-axis shows residual attendance, or observed attendance minus predicted attendance based on the fixed effects, meaning that each point represents how many more (or fewer) fans showed up than we would have expected, controlling for the team, season, timing, and Caitlin Clark. This allows us to visually understand the effect of rolling win count on attendance by removing variance from other sources from the plot. Looking at the highlighted points, which represent games in which Caitlin Clark played, we see that most have negative residuals. This means that when she is on the court, the rolling win count does not affect attendance in the way we would otherwise expect.

## Individual Player Contributions to Team Success and Attendance

In order to better understand individual players' on-court contributions to team success, we attribute team-level winning performance to individual players using the Win Share framework of Oliver (2004), which allocates team wins based on players' offensive and defensive contributions. Player-level box score data were obtained from WNBA player level game logs for the 2024 regular season, including the offensive and defensive statistics necessary to compute Win Shares: minutes, shooting, turnovers, rebounds, steals, blocks, etc.

Offensive Win Shares are the difference between the points a player produced and the points an average offense would be expected to produce in the same number of possessions, scaled by the marginal points per win for the team. Defensive Win Shares are computed by comparing a player's defensive performance to the league average, adjusting for the team's pace and scaled by the marginal points per win for the team. A player's total Win Shares are the sum of the offensive and defensive Win Shares, aggregated to the team level to estimate a player's contribution to the team's seasonal wins. Because Win Shares are derived from box-score statistics, they can provide only an approximation of player impact and shouldn't be interpreted as direct measurements of wins caused by an individual player. We multiply player Win Shares by 112- the marginal effect of a win on attendance estimated in Section 3 to quantify the estimated effect of each player's contribution in the 2024 season.

![Distribution of Player Win Shares in the 2024 Regular Season - dashed line shows mean](images/win_share_distribution_2024.png)

Figure 5 shows the distribution of player win shares in the 2024 regular reason. Player Win Shares are highly skewed, with a small number of players accounting for a disproportionate share of team success. This reflects the nature of a sport like basketball, where star players often have an outsized effect on game outcome.

![Top 15 Player Win Shares and Estimated Attendance Contributions in the 2024 Regular Season](images/top10_player_win_shares.png){width=0.9\textwidth}

Figure 6 shows the offensive and defensive contributions, win shares, and attendance impacts of the top fifteen players of the 2024 regular season ranked by estimated win shares. The top contributors to team success are primarily high-minute players with strong offensive production. It's important to note that Win Shares are dependent on the context of a player's specific team, so a player like A'ja Wilson can have the highest marginal offense and defensive index while being the third best according to Win Shares.

To interpret what the estimated attendance contribution numbers mean in context, we must remind ourselves that the model slope from Section 3 represents the effect of an additional win within a rolling 44 game period. The estimates on attendance from Figure 6, on the other hand, reflect the wins attributable to each of the top 15 players within the 44 game period of a WNBA season. This means that the attendance contribution estimate should be interpreted as the estimated attendance contribution in an imaginary 45th game. It is important to note that these contributions attributable to each player are not *in addition to* the model estimates from above, but rather a decomposition of those estimates. Figure 6 also provides more context to the Caitlin Clark fixed effects reported in Figure 3, proving that her 8,842 fan attendance boost vastly outperforms what you would expect based only on her play.

## Conclusion

By modeling live WNBA game attendance as a function of the winning record of the team over a 44 game rolling period, this study contributes to a body of research investigating the relationship between winning and revenue in sports. We improve on previous research that relies on season-level winning percentages by introducing the rolling win count metric, that more closely reflects the information available to fans in deciding to attend a game. Using this approach, we find a statistically significant relationship between recent winning and game attendance, suggesting that recent team performance plays an important role in shaping fan demand for the WNBA. The team and seasonal fixed effects were also significant, highlighting the importance of team-level characteristics and league-wide trends in explaining attendance patterns.

To connect team success to individual contributions, we allocate team wins to players using win shares, quantifying player-level attendance impacts. While this provides a useful framework for linking individual performance to a proxy for revenue, it's important to remember that win shares are approximations of player value. Thus, we should limit our interpretations of player-level attendance impacts and not interpret them as definitive measures of individual revenue contribution.

Potential expansions upon this research could include computing win shares on the same rolling 44 game period as the win count metric, which would allow us to regress attendance directly onto player contributions. This would expand our ability to identify players like Caitlin Clark who generate more attendance than you would expect based purely off of play. If broader revenue data were available, this model could be used to compare player salaries to their expected contributions to revenue. Generating rigorous and empirical information about revenue attributable to specific players would help players approach Collective Bargaining Agreements with more bargaining power. Beyond expanding player bargaining power, fitting revenue curves to gameplay would help front offices better understand return on investment on top players, helping teams make more informed roster and contract decisions.
