# Overview:
This paper investigates whether a rolling win count measured across a WNBA team's last 44 games can be used to effectively model next game attendance. We build upon existing sports economics literature which finds a team's performance directly impacts their home game attendance, and introduce the rolling win count as a more effective measure of a team's performance than their seasonal winning percentage.
